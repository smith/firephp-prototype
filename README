h1. FirePHP Prototype

Extensions to the FirePHP Firebug Extension for use with server-side JavaScript and the Prototype JavaScript Framework

These files allow you to use the "FirePHP":http://firephp.org/ "Firebug":http://getfirebug.com Extension with the "Jaxer":http://aptana.com/jaxer or ASP(Active Server Pages) environments. They require the "Prototype JavaScript Framework":http://prototypejs.org/.

The fb function and console namespace have two separate implementations: one for Jaxer and one for ASP. This is because of the subtle differences between the platforms.

All code here is a proof of concept and should not be depended on for production purposes. No testing has been done, but it appears to work.
